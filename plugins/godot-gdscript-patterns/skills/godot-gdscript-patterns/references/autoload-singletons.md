# Autoload Singletons Pattern

Global singletons for game state management and event communication in Godot 4.x.

## EventBus

```gdscript
# event_bus.gd (Global signal bus)
extends Node

# Player events
signal player_spawned(player: Node2D)
signal player_died(player: Node2D)
signal player_health_changed(health: int, max_health: int)

# Enemy events
signal enemy_spawned(enemy: Node2D)
signal enemy_died(enemy: Node2D, position: Vector2)

# Item events
signal item_collected(item_type: StringName, value: int)
signal powerup_activated(powerup_type: StringName)

# Level events
signal level_started(level_number: int)
signal level_completed(level_number: int, time: float)
signal checkpoint_reached(checkpoint_id: int)
