  "prompt": "Implement a state machine for a Godot 4 character that can switch between Idle, Running, and Jumping states. The character uses CharacterBody2D and needs to detect state transitions based on velocity and input.",
  "assertions": [
    "The code uses static typing with type annotations (e.g., var speed: float = 200.0)",
    "The implementation uses GDScript (not C# or other languages)",
    "The state machine references or uses CharacterBody2D",
    "The code uses signals with proper Godot 4 syntax",
    "State transitions are handled without tight coupling",
    "The code follows Godot 4 patterns (not Godot 3 syntax)"
