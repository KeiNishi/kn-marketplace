# Progress Log Response

## Summary

I read the three existing docs_for_ai files to understand the project structure and implementation plan, then created a progress log entry recording the completion of Phase 1, Task 1 (Player Movement).

## Context From Documentation

**Project:** Cat Platformer (Unity 2D side-scrolling platformer)

**From GameDesignOverview.md:**
- A 2D side-scrolling platformer where a cat collects fish and avoids dogs across 5 levels.

**From ImplementationPlanOverview.md:**
- Phase 1: Player Systems - Status: In Progress
- Phase 2: Level Systems - Status: Pending
- Dependencies: Unity 6.3 LTS, UniTask

**From 01_Player_Implementation.md:**
- Phase 1, Task 1: Player Movement
  - Files: `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs`, `Assets/_Project/Scripts/Player/PlayerModel.cs`
  - Implement WASD/arrow key movement with Rigidbody2D
  - Add jump mechanic with space bar
- Phase 1, Task 2: Animation (still pending)

## Approach (Without Skill)

Without a dedicated skill, I manually:
1. Read each docs_for_ai file to understand the project structure.
2. Identified the correct phase, task, and files from the implementation plan.
3. Manually authored a `TaskProgress.md` file with a structured progress log table.
4. Saved all required output files to the outputs directory.

This approach requires manually interpreting the documentation structure and writing the progress log format from scratch each time, without any standardized template or automation.
