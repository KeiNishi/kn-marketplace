## Steps Taken

### Step 1: Read GameDesignOverview.md

- Result: Learned the project is a 2D cat platformer with 5 levels, 1 player, 3 enemy types, 20+ collectibles per level.

### Step 2: Read ImplementationPlanOverview.md
- File: `/home/user/kn-marketplace/plugins/kn-gamedev-workflow/skills/implementation-workflow-workspace/iteration-1/eval-progress-log/without_skill/work/docs_for_ai/ImplementationPlanOverview.md`
- Result: Confirmed Phase 1 (Player Systems) is "In Progress", Phase 2 (Level Systems) is "Pending". Dependencies are Unity 6.3 LTS and UniTask.

### Step 3: Read 01_Player_Implementation.md
- File: `/home/user/kn-marketplace/plugins/kn-gamedev-workflow/skills/implementation-workflow-workspace/iteration-1/eval-progress-log/without_skill/work/docs_for_ai/implementation/01_Player_Implementation.md`
- Result: Identified Task 1 (Player Movement) and Task 2 (Animation). Confirmed the files modified: `PlayerController.cs` and `PlayerModel.cs`.

### Step 4: Check outputs directory
- Path: `/home/user/kn-marketplace/plugins/kn-gamedev-workflow/skills/implementation-workflow-workspace/iteration-1/eval-progress-log/without_skill/outputs/`
- Result: Directory did not exist; created it.

### Step 5: Create TaskProgress.md
- Authored a structured progress log with a summary table for all tasks across both phases.
- Marked Phase 1, Task 1 as COMPLETE with the date 2026-02-28 and the files modified.
- Saved to outputs directory.

### Step 6: Create response.md

- Included a section describing the manual approach taken without a skill.
- Saved to outputs directory.

### Step 7: Create transcript.md
- Wrote this step-by-step record of actions taken.
- Saved to outputs directory.

### Step 8: Create metrics.json
- Recorded total_steps and errors_encountered.
