## Steps Taken

1. Read `SKILL.md` at `/home/user/kn-marketplace/plugins/kn-gamedev-workflow/skills/implementation-workflow/SKILL.md` to understand the implementation-workflow skill rules and format.

2. Read existing `docs_for_ai/` files in parallel:
   - `GameDesignOverview.md` — Cat Platformer, 2D side-scroller, 5 levels
   - `ImplementationPlanOverview.md` — Phase 1 (Player Systems, In Progress), Phase 2 (Level Systems, Pending)
   - `implementation/01_Player_Implementation.md` — Phase 1, Task 1: Player Movement (PlayerController.cs, PlayerModel.cs), Task 2: Animation

3. Read the template reference at `references/taskprogress-template.md` to confirm the correct structure for `TaskProgress.md`.

4. Determined format: Modular (ImplementationPlanOverview.md present). TaskProgress.md does not yet exist — must create new.

5. Created `docs_for_ai/TaskProgress.md` in the work directory with:
   - Status line: Phase 1/2 - Player Systems | Next: Animation (Phase 1, Task 2) | Updated: 2026-02-28
   - Log entry for Player Movement [Phase 1, Task 1] referencing the two modified files

6. Created outputs directory (did not exist yet).

7. Copied `TaskProgress.md` to outputs directory.

8. Wrote `response.md`, `transcript.md`, and `metrics.json` to outputs directory.
