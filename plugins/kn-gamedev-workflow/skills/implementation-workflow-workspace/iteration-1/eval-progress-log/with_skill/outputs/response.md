## What Was Done

The implementation-workflow skill was used to log completed progress for the Unity platformer project (Cat Platformer).

### Context Verification

- Confirmed `docs_for_ai/` folder exists with the modular format (ImplementationPlanOverview.md present).
- Read `GameDesignOverview.md`: 2D cat platformer with 5 levels, fish collectibles, and dog enemies.
- Read `ImplementationPlanOverview.md`: Phase 1 (Player Systems) is In Progress; Phase 2 (Level Systems) is Pending. Total 2 phases.
- Read `implementation/01_Player_Implementation.md`: Confirmed Phase 1, Task 1 is "Player Movement" with files `PlayerController.cs` and `PlayerModel.cs`.

### TaskProgress.md Created

Since `docs_for_ai/TaskProgress.md` did not exist, a new file was created using the template from `references/taskprogress-template.md`.

The file includes:
- **Status line**: Phase 1/2 - Player Systems | Next: Animation (Phase 1, Task 2) | Updated: 2026-02-28
- **Log entry**: Records completion of Player Movement (Phase 1, Task 1) with the two modified files and a concise 2-sentence summary.

### Files Created

- `docs_for_ai/TaskProgress.md` — created in the work directory
- Copied to the outputs directory
