The agent produced a response that lists git status as a step but never ran it.

As written, an agent that outputs a canned command template without any real git inspection can pass this check."

The checklist items are present (using '- [ ]' syntax) but under a differently named section.

    "overall": "The assertions catch format compliance (conventional commit type, summary section) well, but miss the most critical outcome: whether the PR was actually created. The git status assertion is also weakened by ambiguity between 'shown in output' and 'actually executed'."
